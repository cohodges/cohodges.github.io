## Applications of Databases


This semester, I am taking CPSC 350, _Applications of Databases_. Out of all the computer science classes I've taken at UMW so far, this is one of the classes I have been more interested in. The class covers the SQL and database design, as well as the implementaton of different kinds of databases into web applications. Database design and SQL are two topics that I have been excited to learn about, as a CIS, Accouning double-major. They are topics in computer science that seem to be more obviously related to business and accounting. The web application side of this class is just a plus. Up until starting this class, I had never really played around with html or learned much about creating websites (outside of using WordPress). The web developement side of this class has been really fun!

Some of the posts you can find on this blog discuss topics I have learned as part of this class.
