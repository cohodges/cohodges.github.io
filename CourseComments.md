## CPSC 350 end of semester comments/thoughts

To start, I think this class has been awesome overall. The material has been some of the most interesting to me out of all the CPSC classes I’ve taken so far. I had been interested in learning about databases and SQL, and learning to create web apps and websites is really cool. I enjoyed having your videos available to watch at any time, and I even thought the xp system was a cool idea.

Keeping the current structure of the class mostly intact, I think having in class lectures would have helped. I don’t mean lecturing during the two hours of class time, rather having the first hour or so of class being dedicated to going over a certain topic. Maybe only topics that are vital to the class and rudiments and which a lot of people seem to struggle with. I think the videos are great, and I don’t think you need to lecture for all the topics covered in the videos, but maybe explanations of Flask, session variables, SocketIO, or even sprints and TargetProcess throughout the semester would be helpful. Perhaps you could do these early on, on days when there isn’t a RAT or lightning round.

One potential issue I noticed with the class was the conflict between the group project and the rudiments. To perform well in the project, it is helpful to have completed certain rudiments. But if I had to choose between working on the project and a rudiment, I would typically choose the project, because I had an obligation to my group to work on it. And when some members aren’t finished with a rudiment and they have pressure to work on the project, it can cause them to have issues with the project. I’m not sure how to really alleviate this in an xp based class, but maybe certain changes could be made. Maybe some rudiments could have due dates? That might undermine the entire idea behind the class.

### Some thoughts on grades:

I would like to focus more on learning instead of grades, but there is so much value put on this metric. Employers don’t just look at grades (in fact, you need to have more than just a good GPA), but that is still a consideration, or a floor, for employment. And really, the goal of finding a job is just as important, if not more important, to me as learning things I want to learn is. Scholarships also consider GPA (still, other things can be considered), and that is also huge. Because of these pressures that are put on students to have a high GPA, they tend to allocate their limited time wherever is best for their GPA. Perhaps the stress that comes with grades and GPAs is part of why people don’t perform as well when graded.

I had a professor who wanted all his students to get an A. He didn’t have deadlines and had minimal required work for the class, and in this way, he tried to avoid having people worry about their grades and focus on learning. That setup did a pretty good job of removing the stress of grades, but maybe not the best job of measuring performance. And as much as I was interested in the content of the class, its priority typically fell pretty low, because I had assignments in other classes that impacted my grades. Maybe people would be better about studying things because they are interested in them if they didn’t have any classes with grades? But you can’t really change that.
