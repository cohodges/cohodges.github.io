When I was in high school, I did a project for my College Preparation class in which I took some personality tests and then researched a career that fit my personality. I chose to research “personal financial adviser,” and from there I did my own research on the career of accounting. Accounting appealed to me, because it seemed like something I could be good at and something that could provide me with a stable career that would allow me to support the people I love.

So, when I came to UMW, I decided to try out accounting. I also thought that since I had the courses to spare, I should study something else I was interested in and add a second major. I didn’t really have any idea what computer science was, and I had never coded in my life, but I decided to try out computer science during my second year at UMW. I had friends majoring in the subject, and I wanted to learn more about it. Now, I am in my senior year at UMW, double-majoring in accounting and computer information systems.

I am currently job hunting for a position at a public accounting firm for after I graduate in May, 2017.
